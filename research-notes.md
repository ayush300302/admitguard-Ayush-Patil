# Research Notes: Vibe Coding

## What is Vibe Coding?
Vibe Coding is a paradigm shift in software development where the engineer focuses on **intent, aesthetics, and high-level architecture** while leveraging AI to handle the boilerplate and implementation details. It’s about "coding by feel" and iterative refinement rather than manual line-by-line typing.

## Key Learnings
- **Intent is King**: The quality of the output is directly proportional to the clarity of the initial "vibe" or vision.
- **Iterative Refinement**: Instead of one large prompt, Vibe Coding works best through a conversation—building a core, then layering features (Validation -> UI -> Audit).
- **Design Recipes**: Using pre-defined aesthetic "recipes" (like the Technical Dashboard or Clean Utility patterns) allows for instant, professional-grade UI without custom CSS.
- **AI as a Senior Pair**: The AI doesn't just write code; it suggests architectural improvements (like moving rules to a config object) that a human might skip in a rush.
